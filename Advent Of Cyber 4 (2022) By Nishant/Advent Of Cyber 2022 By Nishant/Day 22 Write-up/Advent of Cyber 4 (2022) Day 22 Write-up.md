# [Day 22] Attack Surface Reduction Threats are failing all around me

In today’s task, we will discuss attack vectors, attack surface, and attack surface reduction using various methods.

# Learning Objectives

To help McSkidy with her improvements, we will learn some concepts and evaluate some steps to take. These will include:

-   Understand what an attack vector is.
-   Understand the idea of the attack surface.
-   Some practical examples of attack surface reduction techniques that McSkidy can utilize to strengthen Santa’s network.

# Attack Vectors

An attack vector is a tool, technique, or method used to attack a computer system or network. If we map the attack vectors to the physical world, attack vectors would be the weapons an adversary uses, like, swords, arrows, hammers, etc. A non-exhaustive list of examples of attack vectors in cybersecurity includes the following:

-   Phishing emails; Deceptive emails that are often impersonating someone and asking the victim to perform an action that compromises their security.
-   Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks; Sending so many requests to a website or web application that it reaches its limits and can no longer serve legitimate requests.
-   Web drive-by attacks; Flaws in web browsers that compromise the security of the victim by merely visiting a website.
-   Unpatched Vulnerability exploitation; A flaw in the internet-facing infrastructure, such as the web server or the network interface, that is exploited to take control of the infrastructure.

# Attack Surface

The attack surface is the area of a victim that can be impacted by an attack vector, causing damage. In physical terms, it’s the unarmoured body of a soldier. In cybersecurity, it includes:

-   An email server that is used for sending and receiving emails.
-   An internet-facing web server that serves a website to visitors.
-   End-user machines that people use to connect to the network.
-   Humans can be manipulated and tricked into giving control of the network to an attacker through social engineering.

# Attack Surface Reduction

You can’t eliminate the attack surface; only reduce it. The Greek Phalanx (picture) is an example, as it held back a larger Persian army at Thermopylae. This technique won’t work against modern weapons, though. Cybersecurity leaders aim to create a digital equivalent of the Greek Phalanx to keep operations running with minimal attack surface.

Answer: No answer needed

# Closure

We learned the basics of attack vectors and attack surface. Today’s task taught us about different types of attack vectors and surface. We also discussed how to reduce the attack surface by implementing different security and defense mechanisms.
