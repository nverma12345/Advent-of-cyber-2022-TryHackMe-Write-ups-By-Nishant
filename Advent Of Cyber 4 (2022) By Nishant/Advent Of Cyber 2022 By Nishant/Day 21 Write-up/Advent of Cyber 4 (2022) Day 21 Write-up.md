# Day 21] MQTT Have yourself a merry little webcam

Today’s task will discuss the basics of IoT and its protocols. We will cover how IoT devices communicate with each other and what protocols they are using. We will also learn about the MQTT protocol, its functionality, and how it can become vulnerable.

# Learning Objectives

-   Explain the Internet of Things, why it is essential, and if we should be concerned about its danger.
-   Understand the difference between an IoT-specific protocol and other network service protocols.
-   Understand what a publish/subscribe model is and how it interacts with IoT devices.
-   Analyze and exploit the behavior of a vulnerable IoT device.

# What is the Internet of Things

The **I**nternet **o**f **T**hings (**IoT**) categorizes “things.” Devices are interconnected and rely heavily on communication to achieve a device’s objectives. Examples of IoT include thermostats, web cameras, and smart fridges, to name only a few.

While the formal definition of IoT may change depending on who is setting it, the term can best be used as a broad categorization of “a device that sends and receives data to communicate with other devices and systems.”

# Introduction to IoT Protocols

An “IoT protocol” is any protocol used for machine-to-machine, machine-to-gateway, or machine-to-cloud communication, with the primary objectives of being efficient, reliable, and secure. Protocols can be divided into two types: IoT data protocols, which use the TCP/IP model, and IoT network protocols, which rely on wireless technology. Examples of data protocols include HTTP, SMB, and FTP, while network protocols include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, and Z-Wave.
