# [Day 6] Email Analysis Itâ€™s beginning to look a lot like phishing

Todayâ€™s task discusses email analysis. We will discuss how to identify spooky suspicious emails and how to extract data from them. Also, we are going to perform the further investigation using different tools.

# Learning Objectives

-   Learn what email analysis is and why it still matters.
-   Learn the email header sections.
-   Learn the essential questions to ask in email analysis.
-   Learn how to use email header sections to evaluate an email.
-   Learn to use additional tools to discover email attachments and conduct further investigation.
-   Help the Elf team investigate the suspicious email received.

# What is Email Analysis?

Email analysis extracts the email header information to expose the email file details. The email header contains the technical details of the email, like sender, recipient, path, return address and attachments. Usually, these details are enough to determine if there is something suspicious/abnormal in the email and decide on further actions on the email, like filtering/quarantining or delivering. This process can be done manually and with the help of tools.

A common security issue regarding emails is Phishing attacks.

**Phishing:**Â Phishing is a sub-section of social engineering delivered through email to trick someone into either revealing personal information and credentials or executing malicious code on their computer.
