# [Day 23] Defence in Depth Mission ELFPossible: Abominable for a Day

Today’s task will cover the importance of Defense in Depth in security measures of an organization or individual. We will cover various ways of implementing extra layers of security defense.

# Learning Objectives

-   Understand the basics of Defense in Depth
-   Understand its importance
-   Learn various ways to implement Defense in Depth

# Contrasting the Past and the Modern Takes on Defensive Security

Castle walls are fortified to protect from attack, yet attackers may breach them and mark the start of the castle’s end, depending on the defenders’ response. Modern security teams have moved away from this approach and are taking steps to secure more than just the perimeter. This includes awareness of potential single points of failure, having additional defensive layers, and protecting the _crown jewels_.

# Disrupting Adversarial Objectives

Defense in Depth focuses on disrupting adversaries’ objectives by having varying levels of protection. Level 1 consists of perimeter security with prevention mechanisms. Level 2 adds layers but concentrates solely on prevention. Level 3 has well-rounded defenses, leveraging sensors, analytics, and response capabilities. The goal is to limit the mistakes bad guys need to make while only requiring them to make a mistake once.

To learn more, check out Day 23.

# Closure

In today’s task, we learned modern security practices are composed of layers. Stopping attacks from the get-go is very helpful — ideal even, but it’s not always possible. Everyone can and will be compromised — it’s just a matter of when, and it’s up to every one of us to disrupt them from being able to do what they intend to do and in every step of the way.
