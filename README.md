## Installation

### Installing Obsidian

#### On Windows

Go to [the download page](https://obsidian.md/download)... and click Download. Once it's downloaded, double click the executable to run it.

### Downloading the Vault

You will need to [download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This is a quick and easy process.

On Windows, open the Start Menu and search for 'Git Bash', then click it to open a bash terminal (or navigate to the folder you want to install the notes into, then right-click and press 'Git Bash Here'). On Unix, open a terminal of your choice.

In this Git Bash/terminal, type the following:

```bash
git clone 
```

If you are uncomfortable using the command line, you can install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) instead.

Once you have cloned the repsitory, open Obsidian and click `Open folder as vault`, then select the `Advent Of Cyber 2022 By Nishant` folder that was just created by Git. You're ready to go!
